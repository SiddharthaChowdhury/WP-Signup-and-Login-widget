# Sid Register and Login Widget
A very simple,dynamic and minimalistic signup-signing-widget WordPress-plugin, provided with which is a rich admin control UI to configure every bits and pieces of the widget.

Its responsive so you can use it anywhere in a WP page. Be it sidebar, footer or page-body. It fits in almost all parts of a typical WordPress site

I created this plugin couple of monnths ago out of an urgent need and have modified it several times in several WP-sites.
Its works fine
Download and install the plugin if u need a custom signup/login widget
